          <p>I am a <Strong>Theoretical Immunologist</Strong> who ardently and sometimes a bit arrogantly tries to explain a everything and anything in biology in the light of evolution.
          In my head I often treat day to day chores and problems as unyielding mysteries and puzzles and play pretend while solving them.
          <br><br>

          I deeply care about the consequnces of my actions on the environment and put in efforts to reduce contributions to climate change.
          Striving to bring social justice and equal opportunities in education  for all.
